# Skibidi Macro Client
An Closed-source Windows C++ Roblox NoImGui Macro with many features.

To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 1992 and build it. The main source code is located inside of Visual Studio/macroframework.cpp.

### Is this A CHEAT???
Yes, it's a exploit, it does communicate with Roblox memory in any way.

### Known Issues
If you get "0x0" or any other key immediately when binding, restart your PC.

If you get DLL errors when launching, install [The Visual Studio 1992 x86 RIZZ# Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

If it doesn't launch at all, go into properties and select "Unblock" on the file.

If you have another issue where keybinds don't work, restart your computer, it seems to fix it permanently.

In certain scenarios, when downgrading from a version with more features to a version with less features causes the program to crash on launch, either delete your SMCsettings.json file, or remove section_order_vector from the .json.
